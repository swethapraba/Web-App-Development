<h1>Hello World!</h1>
<h4> This summer I did a whole bunch of things... </h4>
<p>
<ol> 
	<li> 
		Dance! I've been learning <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharata_Natyam"> Bharatanatyam </a>
	 	seriously for about 8 years now and completed my <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arangetram"> arangetram</a> this summer! :) This took a significant amount of time and training, including:
		<ul>
			<li> Lots of practice, with each one scheduled for about 2-3 hours, but running closer to 5-6 hours each day
			</li>
			<li>
				Significant amounts of time outside of practice devoted to purchasing jewelry, cloth, visiting tailors to stitch costumes, and procuring other supplies for the big day.
			</li>
			<li>
				Spend lots of time designing invitations, brochures, talking to photographers and makeup artists, and other logistical preparations for the performance (though to be fair, I was lucky enough to be able to outsource a lot of this work to my mother)
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
		Travel! I did my arangetram in India, so I got to do some traveling in South India this summer.
	</li>
</ol>
